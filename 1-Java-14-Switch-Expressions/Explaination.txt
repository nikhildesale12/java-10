Java 12 introduces expressions to Switch statement and released it as a preview feature. 
Java 13 added a new yield construct to return a value from switch statement. With Java 14, switch expression now is a standard feature.

Each case block can return a value using yield statement.

In case of enum, default case can be skipped. In other cases, default case is required.
